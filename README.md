# Basic-Python-Auto-Clicker
A basic python auto clicker that I created to cheat in cookie clicker. Very basic and made in 2 minutes

To use it:
  - Ensure that python is installed and that the mouse and keyboard module have been installed
      - If they aren't, install them using pip https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/ 
  - Press the w key to start the program
  - After this, press q if you want to exit the program or e to pause it
  - Press w to start again if you have paused it
